# BNF Model Validation Improvements

## Overview

The `bnf-model validate` command has been significantly enhanced to provide comprehensive analysis of BNF grammar files with improved error reporting and useful warnings.

## New Features

### üîç Orphan Node Detection
- **Feature**: Automatically detects nodes that are defined but never referenced
- **Output**: Warning messages that suggest cleanup or verification
- **Example**: `Found 2 orphan (unreferenced) node(s): Number, Whitespace`

### üõ°Ô∏è Regex Pattern Validation  
- **Feature**: Validates regex patterns for JavaScript compatibility
- **Output**: Clear error messages for invalid regex syntax
- **Example**: `Token node "BadRegex" has invalid regex pattern: missing terminating ] for character class`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improved Warning System
- **Feature**: Focused, actionable warnings instead of noise
- **Removed**: Overly broad "complex regex pattern" warnings
- **Added**: Specific warnings for potential PEG.js conflicts and very long patterns

## Usage

```bash
# Basic validation
bun bnf-model validate grammar.yaml

# Verbose output with detailed progress
bun bnf-model validate grammar.yaml --verbose

# Save validation report to file
bun bnf-model validate grammar.yaml -o report.txt
```

## Example Output

### ‚úÖ Successful Validation with Warnings
```
‚úÖ BNF model validation passed

‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings:
  1. Found 2 orphan (unreferenced) node(s): Number, Whitespace
  2. Consider removing orphan nodes if they are not needed, or check if references are missing

üìã Model Summary:
  Name: BNFGrammar
  Version: 1.0.0
  Start rule: Grammar
  Total nodes: 32
  - Token nodes: 13
  - Deduction nodes: 17
  - Union nodes: 2
```

### ‚ùå Failed Validation with Errors
```
‚ùå BNF model validation failed

Errors:
  1. Token node "BadRegex" has invalid regex pattern: missing terminating ] for character class
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Issue Detection**: Catch orphan nodes and invalid regex patterns early
2. **Cleaner Output**: Focused warnings instead of excessive noise
3. **Better Debugging**: Clear error messages with specific pattern issues
4. **Maintenance Help**: Identify unused nodes for potential cleanup
5. **Integrated Workflow**: All validation in one command instead of separate tools

## Integration

The orphan node detection functionality has been integrated directly into the BNF parser, replacing the previous standalone `find-orphan-nodes.ts` script. This provides a unified validation experience with consistent output formatting.
